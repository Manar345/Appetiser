                At this early stage, it’s not possible to provide an estimate of
                the total cost, just a guideline. The cost of the design and
                discovery phase is decided closer to the start of our
                collaboration. It’s best to start there and move forward using a
                payment milestones plan to keep track of the cost better as the
                idea evolves.

              <p>
                Keep in mind that expertly developed web and mobile apps come at
                a premium. It’s easy to forget that teams of designers,
                strategists, and managers are involved in making your app a
                success. It’s possible to get a product built for a price that’s
                too good to be true, only to have costs spiral through bug fixes
                and constant improvements because the quality wasn’t there from
                the start.

                From working with our app developers, Sydney trade company Amber
                Tiles saw exponential growth. The locally managed and owned
                business looked to the future and commissioned an app to help
                with everyday tasks for the building industry. They tapped
                Appetiser for our mobile app development services.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Amber Tradie app is a must-have app for the Australian
                building, tiling, and landscaping industry. The app also gives
                you immediate access to trade-specific news, specials and
                events, how-tos, and other helpful articles relevant to your
                business.

                A sector that is perceived as traditional by many saw an
                opportunity to leverage app development to complement its more
                conventional channels. A move that more and more trade companies
                are exploring.
